# Full version:

I supervised Chian Hao during his intern program with NEC. Under my guidance he completed 2 projects.

1. Mask detection, where he had to develop an ai-based system to detect if a person is wearing mask. Choan Hao llearned new technologies required for the task, and exibited independent drive aand problem-solving skills to bring the task to completion.

2. Car movement direction detection is a plugin to our industrial-grade video-analytic system. Chian Hao implemented simple and novel aproach to analyzing vehicle direction. His solution was very performant, and he mastered the technologies needed to implement it as well as the interface to the video analytics system. The plugin found extensive use in many demo scenarios for our customers.

In general, I found Chian Hao to be responsible, hard-working and with good communication skills, which is especially important if we are to work in a remote setting. Given his interest in technology and drive, I would be happy to work with him again.
